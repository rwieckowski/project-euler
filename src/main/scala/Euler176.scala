/**
The four rightangled triangles with sides 91215 121620 51213 and 1235
37 all have one of the shorter sides catheti equal to 12 It can be 
shown that no other integer sided rightangled triangle exists with one 
of the catheti equal to 12

Find the smallest integer that can be the length of a cathetus of 
exactly 47547 different integer sided rightangled triangles
