/**
It is well known that if the square root of a natural number is not an 
integer then it is irrational The decimal expansion of such square 
roots is infinite without any repeating pattern at all

The square root of two is 141421356237309504880 and the digital sum of 
the first one hundred decimal digits is 475

For the first one hundred natural numbers find the total of the 
digital sums of the first one hundred decimal digits for all the 
irrational square roots
