Let ABC be a triangle with all interior angles being less than 120 
degrees Let X be any point inside the triangle and let XA  p XC  q and 
XB  r

Fermat challenged Torricelli to find the position of X such that p  q  
r was minimised

Torricelli was able to prove that if equilateral triangles AOB BNC and 
AMC are constructed on each side of triangle ABC the circumscribed 
circles of AOB BNC and AMC will intersect at a single point T inside 
the triangle Moreover he proved that T called the TorricelliFermat 
point minimises p  q  r Even more remarkable it can be shown that when 
the sum is minimised AN  BM  CO  p  q  r and that AN BM and CO also 
intersect at T<div style='text-align:center;'>
