Let <var>n</var> be a positive integer Suppose there are stations at

<var>i</var> le 2<var>n</var> We will consider stations with the same 
coordinates as the same station

We wish to form a path from 0 0 to <var>n</var> <var>n</var> such that 
the x and y coordinates never decrease
Let S<var>n</var> be the maximum number of stations such a path can 
pass through

For example if <var>n</var>  22 there are 11 distinct stations and a 
valid path can pass through at most 5 stations Therefore S22  5The 
case is illustrated below with an example of an optimal path

It can also be verified that S123  14 and S10000  48
