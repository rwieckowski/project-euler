/**
Consider the fraction <i>nd</i> where <i>n</i> and <i>d</i> are 
positive integers If <i>n</i>lt<i>d</i> and HCF<i>nd</i>1 it is called 
a reduced proper fraction

If we list the set of reduced proper fractions for <i>d</i> le 8 in 
ascending order of size we get

18 17 16 15 14 27 13 38 <b>25</b> 37 12 47 35 58 23 57 34 45 56 67 78

It can be seen that 25 is the fraction immediately to the left of 37

By listing the set of reduced proper fractions for <i>d</i> le 1000000 
in ascending order of size find the numerator of the fraction 
immediately to the left of 37
