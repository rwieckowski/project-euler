/**
Three mirrors are arranged in the shape of an equilateral triangle 
with their reflective surfaces pointing inwards There is an 
infinitesimal gap at each vertex of the triangle through which a laser 
beam may pass

Label the vertices A B and C There are 2 ways in which a laser beam 
may enter vertex C bounce off 11 surfaces then exit through the same 
vertex one way is shown below the other is the reverse of that
