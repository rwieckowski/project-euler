/**
It was proposed by Christian Goldbach that every odd composite number 
can be written as the sum of a prime and twice a square

9  7  2times1<sup>2</sup>
15  7  2times2<sup>2</sup>
21  3  2times3<sup>2</sup>
25  7  2times3<sup>2</sup>
27  19  2times2<sup>2</sup>
33  31  2times1<sup>2</sup>

It turns out that the conjecture was false

What is the smallest odd composite that cannot be written as the sum 
of a prime and twice a square
