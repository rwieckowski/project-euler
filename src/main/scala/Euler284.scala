/**
The 3digit number 376 in the decimal numbering system is an example of 
numbers with the special property that its square ends with the same 
digits 376<sup>2</sup>  141376 Lets call a number with this property a 
steady square

Steady squares can also be observed in other numbering systems In the 
base 14 numbering system the 3digit number c37 is also a steady square 
c37<sup>2</sup>  aa0c37 and the sum of its digits is c3718 in the same 
numbering system The letters a b c and d are used for the 10 11 12 and 
13 digits respectively in a manner similar to the hexadecimal 
numbering system

For 1 le n le 9 the sum of the digits of all the ndigit steady squares 
in the base 14 numbering system is 2d8 582 decimal Steady squares with 
leading 0s are not allowed

Find the sum of the digits of all the ndigit steady squares in the 
base 14 numbering system for<BR>1 le n le 10000 decimal and give your 
answer in the base 14 system using lower case letters where necessary
