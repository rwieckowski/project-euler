/**
Eulers Totient function phi<var>n</var> sometimes called the phi 
function is used to determine the number of positive numbers less than 
or equal to <var>n</var> which are relatively prime to <var>n</var> 
For example as 1 2 4 5 7 and 8 are all less than nine and relatively 
prime to nine phi96
The number 1 is considered to be relatively prime to every positive 
number so phi11 

Interestingly phi8710979180 and it can be seen that 87109 is a 
permutation of 79180

Find the value of <var>n</var> 1 lt <var>n</var> lt 10<sup>7</sup> for 
which phi<var>n</var> is a permutation of <var>n</var> and the ratio 
<var>n</var>phi<var>n</var> produces a minimum
