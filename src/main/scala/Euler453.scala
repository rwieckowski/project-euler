/**
A <b>simple quadrilateral</b> is a polygon that has four distinct 
vertices has no straight angles and does not selfintersect

Let Qm n be the number of simple quadrilaterals whose vertices are 
lattice points with coordinates xy satisfying 0 le x le m and 0 le y 
le n

For example Q2 2  94 as can be seen below

It can also be verified that Q3 7  39590 Q12 3  309000 and Q123 45  
70542215894646

Find Q12345 6789 mod 135707531
