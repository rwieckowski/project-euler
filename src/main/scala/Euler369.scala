/**
In a standard 52 card deck of playing cards a set of 4 cards is a <b>
Badugi</b> if it contains 4 cards with no pairs and no two cards of 
the same suit

Let f<var>n</var> be the number of ways to choose <var>n</var> cards 
with a 4 card subset that is a Badugi  For example there are 2598960 
ways to choose five cards from a standard 52 card deck of which 514800 
contain a 4 card subset that is a Badugi so f5  514800
