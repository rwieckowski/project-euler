/**
Working from lefttoright if no digit is exceeded by the digit to its 
left it is called an increasing number for example 134468

Similarly if no digit is exceeded by the digit to its right it is 
called a decreasing number for example 66420

We shall call a positive integer that is neither increasing nor 
decreasing a quotbouncyquot number for example 155349

As <i>n</i> increases the proportion of bouncy numbers below <i>n</i> 
increases such that there are only 12951 numbers below onemillion that 
are not bouncy and only 277032 nonbouncy numbers below 10<sup>10</sup>

How many numbers below a googol 10<sup>100</sup> are not bouncy
