/**
It turns out that 12 cm is the smallest length of wire that can be 
bent to form an integer sided right angle triangle in exactly one way 
but there are many more examples

<b>12 cm</b> 345
<b>24 cm</b> 6810
<b>30 cm</b> 51213
<b>36 cm</b> 91215
<b>40 cm</b> 81517
<b>48 cm</b> 121620

In contrast some lengths of wire like 20 cm cannot be bent to form an 
integer sided right angle triangle and other lengths allow more than 
one solution to be found for example using 120 cm it is possible to 
form exactly three different integer sided right angle triangles

<b>120 cm</b> 304050 204852 244551

Given that L is the length of the wire for how many values of L le 1
500000 can exactly one integer sided right angle triangle be formed
