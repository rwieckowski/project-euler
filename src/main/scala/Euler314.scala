/**
The moon has been opened up and land can be obtained for free but 
there is a catch You have to build a wall around the land that you 
stake out and building a wall on the moon is expensive Every country 
has been allotted a 500 m by 500 m square area but they will possess 
only that area which they wall in 251001 posts have been placed in a 
rectangular grid with 1 meter spacing The wall must be a closed series 
of straight lines each line running from post to post

The bigger countries of course have built a 2000 m wall enclosing the 
entire 250 000 m<sup>2</sup> area The 
<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Fenwick'>Duchy of Grand 
Fenwick</a> has a tighter budget and has asked you their Royal 
Programmer to compute what shape would get best maximum enclosedarea
walllength ratio

You have done some preliminary calculations on a sheet of paperFor a 
2000 meter wall enclosing the 250 000 m<sup>2</sup> area theenclosed
areawalllength ratio is 125<BR />Although not allowed  but to get an 
idea if this is anything better  if you place a circle inside the 
square area touching the four sides the area will be equal to pi250
<sup>2</sup> m<sup>2</sup> and the perimeter will be pi500 m so the 
enclosedareawalllength ratio will also be 125

However if you cut off from the square four triangles with sides 75 m 
75 m and 75radic2 m the total area becomes 238750 m<sup>2</sup> and 
the perimeter becomes 1400300radic2 m So this gives an enclosedarea
walllength ratio of 13087 which is significantly better
