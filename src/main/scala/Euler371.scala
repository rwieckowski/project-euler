/**
Oregon licence plates consist of three letters followed by a three 
digit number each digit can be from 09<BR />While driving to work Seth 
plays the following game<BR />Whenever the numbers of two licence 
plates seen on his trip add to 1000 thats a win

Eg MIC012 and HAN988 is a win and RYU500 and SET500 too as long as he 
sees them in the same trip 

Find the expected number of plates he needs to see for a win<BR />Give 
your answer rounded to 8 decimal places behind the decimal point

<b>Note</b> We assume that each licence plate seen is equally likely 
to have any three digit number on it</P>
