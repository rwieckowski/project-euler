/**
Fred the farmer arranges to have a new storage silo installed on his 
farm and having an obsession for all things square he is absolutely 
devastated when he discovers that it is circular Quentin the 
representative from the company that installed the silo explains that 
they only manufacture cylindrical silos but he points out that it is 
resting on a square base Fred is not amused and insists that it is 
removed from his property

Quick thinking Quentin explains that when granular materials are 
delivered from above a conical slope is formed and the natural angle 
made with the horizontal is called the angle of repose For example if 
the angle of repose alpha  30 degrees and grain is delivered at the 
centre of the silo then a perfect cone will form towards the top of 
the cylinder In the case of this silo which has a diameter of 6m the 
amount of space wasted would be approximately 32648388556 m<sup>3
</sup> However if grain is delivered at a point on the top which has a 
horizontal distance of x metres from the centre then a cone with a 
strangely curved and sloping base is formed He shows Fred a picture
