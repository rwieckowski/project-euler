/**
The proper divisors of a number are all the divisors excluding the 
number itself For example the proper divisors of 28 are 1 2 4 7 and 14 
As the sum of these divisors is equal to 28 we call it a perfect 
number

Interestingly the sum of the proper divisors of 220 is 284 and the sum 
of the proper divisors of 284 is 220 forming a chain of two numbers 
For this reason 220 and 284 are called an amicable pair

Perhaps less well known are longer chains For example starting with 
12496 we form a chain of five numbers

12496 rarr 14288 rarr 15472 rarr 14536 rarr 14264 rarr 12496 rarr 

Since this chain returns to its starting point it is called an 
amicable chain

Find the smallest member of the longest amicable chain with no element 
exceeding one million
