/**
Let <i>a</i> <i>b</i> <i>c</i> represent the three sides of a right 
angle triangle with integral length sides It is possible to place four 
such triangles together to form a square with length <i>c</i>

For example 3 4 5 triangles can be placed together to form a 5 by 5 
square with a 1 by 1 hole in the middle and it can be seen that the 5 
by 5 square can be tiled with twentyfive 1 by 1 squares
