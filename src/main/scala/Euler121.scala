/**
A bag contains one red disc and one blue disc In a game of chance a 
player takes a disc at random and its colour is noted After each turn 
the disc is returned to the bag an extra red disc is added and another 
disc is taken at random

The player pays pound1 to play and wins if they have taken more blue 
discs than red discs at the end of the game

If the game is played for four turns the probability of a player 
winning is exactly 11120 and so the maximum prize fund the banker 
should allocate for winning in this game would be pound10 before they 
would expect to incur a loss Note that any payout will be a whole 
number of pounds and also includes the original pound1 paid to play 
the game so in the example given the player actually wins pound9

Find the maximum prize fund that should be allocated to a single game 
in which fifteen turns are played
