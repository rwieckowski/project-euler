/**
A rectangular sheet of grid paper with integer dimensions <var>w</var> 
times <var>h</var> is given Its grid spacing is 1
When we cut the sheet along the grid lines into two pieces and 
rearrange those pieces without overlap we can make new rectangles with 
different dimensions

For example from a sheet with dimensions 9 times 4  we can make 
rectangles with dimensions 18 times 2 12 times 3 and 6 times 6 by 
cutting and rearranging as below<div align='center'>
