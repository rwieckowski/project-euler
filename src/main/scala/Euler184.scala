/**
Consider the set <var>I<sub>r</sub></var> of points <var>x</var><var>y
</var> with integer coordinates in the interior of the circle with 
radius <var>r</var> centered at the origin ie <var>x</var><sup>2</sup>  
<var>y</var><sup>2</sup> lt <var>r</var><sup>2</sup>

For a radius of 2 <var>I</var><sub>2</sub> contains the nine points 00 
10 11 01 11 10 11 01 and 11 There are eight triangles having all three 
vertices in <var>I</var><sub>2</sub> which contain the origin in the 
interior Two of them are shown below the others are obtained from 
these by rotation

For a radius of 3 there are 360 triangles containing the origin in the 
interior and having all vertices in <var>I</var><sub>3</sub> and for 
<var>I</var><sub>5</sub> the number is 10600

How many triangles are there containing the origin in the interior and 
having all three vertices in <var>I</var><sub>105</sub>
