/**
Many numbers can be expressed as the sum of a square and a cube Some 
of them in more than one way

Consider the palindromic numbers that can be expressed as the sum of a 
square and a cube both greater than 1 in <b>exactly</b> 4 different 
ways<BR/>For example 5229225 is a palindromic number and it can be 
expressed in exactly 4 different ways
