/**
<P>An mtimesn maze is an mtimesn rectangular grid with walls placed 
between grid cells such that there is exactly one path from the top
left square to any other square <BR />The following are examples of a 
9times12 maze and a 15times20 maze

<img src=project/images/p380_mazes.gif />

Let Cmn be the number of distinct mtimesn mazes Mazes which can be 
formed by rotation and reflection from another maze are considered 
distinct

It can be verified that C11  1 C22  4 C34  2415 and C912  25720e46 in 
scientific notation rounded to 5 significant digits<BR />Find C100500 
and write your answer in scientific notation rounded to 5 significant 
digits

When giving your answer use a lowercase e to separate mantissa and 
exponentEg if the answer is 1234567891011 then the answer format would 
be 12346e12
