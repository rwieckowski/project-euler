/**
We shall define a <i>pythagorean polygon</i>  to be a <b>convex 
polygon</b> with the following properties
<ul><li>there are at least three vertices</li><li>no three vertices 
are aligned</li><li>each vertex has <b>integer coordinates</b></li>
<li>each edge has <b>integer length</b></li></ul>

For a given integer <var>n</var> define P<var>n</var> as the number of 
distinct pythagorean polygons for which the perimeter is lethinsp<var>
n</var>
Pythagorean polygons should be considered distinct as long as none is 
a translation of another
