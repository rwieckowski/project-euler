/**
Consider the number 142857 We can rightrotate this number by moving 
the last digit 7 to the front of it giving us 714285
It can be verified that 7142855times142857
This demonstrates an unusual property of 142857 it is a divisor of its 
rightrotation

Find the last 5 digits of the sum of all integers <var>n</var> 10 lt 
<var>n</var> lt 10<sup>100</sup> that have this property
