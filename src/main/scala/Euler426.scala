/**
<P>Consider an infinite row of boxes Some of the boxes contain a ball 
For example an initial configuration of 2 consecutive occupied boxes 
followed by 2 empty boxes 2 occupied boxes 1 empty box and 2 occupied 
boxes can be denoted by the sequence 2 2 2 1 2 in which the number of 
consecutive occupied and empty boxes appear alternately</P><P>A turn 
consists of moving each ball exactly once according to the following 
rule Transfer the leftmost ball which has not been moved to the 
nearest empty box to its right</P><P>After one turn the sequence 2 2 2 
1 2 becomes 2 2 1 2 3 as can be seen below note that we begin the new 
sequence starting at the first occupied box</P><div align='center'>
