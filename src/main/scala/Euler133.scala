/**
A number consisting entirely of ones is called a repunit We shall 
define R<var>k</var> to be a repunit of length <var>k</var> for 
example R6  111111

Let us consider repunits of the form R10<sup><var>n</var></sup>

Although R10 R100 or R1000 are not divisible by 17 R10000 is divisible 
by 17 Yet there is no value of <var>n</var> for which R10<sup><var>n
</var></sup> will divide by 19 In fact it is remarkable that 11 17 41 
and 73 are the only four primes below onehundred that can be a factor 
of R10<sup><var>n</var></sup>

Find the sum of all the primes below onehundred thousand that will 
never be a factor of R10<sup><var>n</var></sup>
