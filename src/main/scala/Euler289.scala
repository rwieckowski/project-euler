/**
Let C<var>x</var><var>y</var> be a circle passing through the points 
<var>x</var>thinsp<var>y</var> <var>x</var>thinsp<var>y</var>1 <var>x
</var>1thinsp<var>y</var> and <var>x</var>1thinsp<var>y</var>1

For positive integers m and n let E<var>m</var><var>n</var> be a 
configuration which consists of the <var>m</var>middot<var>n</var> 
circles
 C<var>x</var><var>y</var> 0thinsp8804thinsp<var>x</var>thinsp
<&thinsp;<var>m</var> 0thinsp8804thinsp<var>y</var>thinsp
<&thinsp;<var>n</var> <var>x</var> and <var>y</var> are integers 

An Eulerian cycle on E<var>m</var><var>n</var> is a closed path that 
passes through each arc exactly once
Many such paths are possible on E<var>m</var><var>n</var> but we are 
only interested in those which are not selfcrossing A noncrossing path 
just touches itself at lattice points but it never crosses itself

The image below shows E33 and an example of an Eulerian noncrossing 
path
