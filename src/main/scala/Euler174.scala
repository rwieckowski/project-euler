/**
We shall define a square lamina to be a square outline with a square 
quotholequot so that the shape possesses vertical and horizontal 
symmetry

Given eight tiles it is possible to form a lamina in only one way 3x3 
square with a 1x1 hole in the middle However using thirtytwo tiles it 
is possible to form two distinct laminae
