/**
There are several ways to write the number 12 as a sum of inverse 
squares using <i>distinct</i> integers

For instance the numbers 234571215202835 can be used

<img src="project/images/p152_sum.gif" border="0" alt="" />

In fact only using integers between 2 and 45 inclusive there are 
exactly three ways to do it the remaining two being 234679102028353645 
and 23467912152830353645

How many ways are there to write the number 12 as a sum of inverse 
squares using distinct integers between 2 and 80 inclusive
