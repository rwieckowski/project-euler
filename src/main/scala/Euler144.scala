/**
In laser physics a white cell is a mirror system that acts as a delay 
line for the laser beam The beam enters the cell bounces around on the 
mirrors and eventually works its way back out

The specific white cell we will be considering is an ellipse with the 
equation 4<i>x</i><sup>2</sup>  <i>y</i><sup>2</sup>  100

The section corresponding to minus001 le <i>x</i> le 001 at the top is 
missing allowing the light to enter and exit through the hole
