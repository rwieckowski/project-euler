/**
We shall define a sqube to be a number of the form <var>p</var><sup>2
</sup><var>q</var><sup>3</sup> where <var>p</var> and <var>q</var> are 
distinct primes
For example 200  5<sup>2</sup>2<sup>3</sup> or 120072949  23<sup>2
</sup>61<sup>3</sup>

The first five squbes are 72 108 200 392 and 500

Interestingly 200 is also the first number for which you cannot change 
any single digit to make a prime we shall call such numbers primeproof 
The next primeproof sqube which contains the contiguous substring quot
200quot is 1992008

Find the 200th primeproof sqube containing the contiguous substring 
quot200quot
