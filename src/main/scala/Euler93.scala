/**
By using each of the digits from the set 1 2 3 4 exactly once and 
making use of the four arithmetic operations  minus   and brackets
parentheses it is possible to form different positive integer targets

For example

8  4  1  3  2
14  4  3  1  2
19  4  2  3 minus 1
36  3  4  2  1

Note that concatenations of the digits like 12  34 are not allowed

Using the set 1 2 3 4 it is possible to obtain thirtyone different 
target numbers of which 36 is the maximum and each of the numbers 1 to 
28 can be obtained before encountering the first nonexpressible number

Find the set of four distinct digits <i>a</i> lt <i>b</i> lt <i>c</i> 
lt <i>d</i> for which the longest set of consecutive positive integers 
1 to <i>n</i> can be obtained giving your answer as a string <i>abcd
</i>
