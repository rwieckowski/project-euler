/**
A number consisting entirely of ones is called a repunit We shall 
define R<i>k</i> to be a repunit of length <i>k</i> for example R6  
111111

Given that <i>n</i> is a positive integer and GCD<i>n</i> 10  1 it can 
be shown that there always exists a value <i>k</i> for which R<i>k</i> 
is divisible by <i>n</i> and let A<i>n</i> be the least such value of 
<i>k</i> for example A7  6 and A41  5

The least value of <i>n</i> for which A<i>n</i> first exceeds ten is 
17

Find the least value of <i>n</i> for which A<i>n</i> first exceeds one
million
