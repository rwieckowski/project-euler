/**
The number sequence game starts with a sequence <var>S</var> of <var>N
</var> numbers written on a line

Two players alternate turns At his turn a player must select and 
remove either the first or the last number remaining in the sequence

The player score is the sum of all the numbers he has taken Each 
player attempts to maximize his own sumIf <var>N</var>  4 and <var>S
</var>  1 2 10 3 then each player maximizes his score as follows<ul>
<li>Player 1 removes the first number 1</li><li>Player 2 removes the 
last number from the remaining sequence 3</li><li>Player 1 removes the 
last number from the remaining sequence 10</li><li>Player 2 removes 
the remaining number 2</li></ul>

Player 1 score is 1  10  11

Let <var>F</var><var>N</var> be the score of player 1 if both players 
follow the optimal strategy for the sequence <var>S</var>  <var>s
