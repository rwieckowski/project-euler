/**
A printing shop runs 16 batches jobs every week and each batch 
requires a sheet of special colourproofing paper of size A5

Every Monday morning the foreman opens a new envelope containing a 
large sheet of the special paper with size A1

He proceeds to cut it in half thus getting two sheets of size A2 Then 
he cuts one of them in half to get two sheets of size A3 and so on 
until he obtains the A5size sheet needed for the first batch of the 
week

All the unused sheets are placed back in the envelope
