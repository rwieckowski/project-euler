/**
Let varphi be the golden ratio varphifrac1sqrt52<BR \>Remarkably it is 
possible to write every positive integer as a sum of powers of varphi 
even if we require that every power of varphi is used at most once in 
this sum<BR \>Even then this representation is not unique<BR \>We can 
make it unique by requiring that no powers with consecutive exponents 
are used and that the representation is finite<BR \>Eg 2varphivarphi2 
and 3varphi2varphi2

To represent this sum of powers of varphi we use a string of 0s and 1s 
with a point to indicate where the negative exponents start<BR />We 
call this the representation in the <b>phigital numberbase</b><BR />So 
11_varphi 21001_varphi 310001_varphi and 14100100001001_varphi <BR />
The strings representing 1 2 and 14 in the phigital number base are 
palindromic while the string representating 3 is not<BR /> the 
phigital point is not the middle character

The sum of the positive integers not exceeding 1000 whose phigital 
representation is palindromic is 4345

Find the sum of the positive integers not exceeding 1010 whose 
phigital representation is palindromic
