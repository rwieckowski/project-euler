/**
An even positive integer N will be called admissible if it is a power 
of 2 or its distinct prime factors are consecutive primes
The first twelve admissible numbers are 24681216182430323648

If N is admissible the smallest integer M gt 1 such that NM is prime 
will be called the pseudoFortunate number for N

For example N630 is admissible since it is even and its distinct prime 
factors are the consecutive primes 235 and 7
 The next prime number after 631 is 641 hence the pseudoFortunate 
number for 630 is M11
It can also be seen that the pseudoFortunate number for 16 is 3

Find the sum of all distinct pseudoFortunate numbers for admissible 
numbers N less than 10<sup>9</sup>
