/**
Susan has a prime frog<BR />Her frog is jumping around over 500 
squares numbered 1 to 500He can only jump one square to the left or to 
the right with equal probability and he cannot jump outside the range 
1500<BR />if it lands at either end it automatically jumps to the only 
available square on the next move

When he is on a square with a prime number on it he croaks P PRIME 
with probability 23 or N NOT PRIME with probability 13 just before 
jumping to the next square<BR />When he is on a square with a number 
on it that is not a prime he croaks P with probability 13 or N with 
probability 23 just before jumping to the next square</P><P>Given that 
the frogs starting position is random with the same probability for 
every square and given that she listens to his first 15 croaks what is 
the probability that she hears the sequence PPPPNNPPPNPPNPN</P>Give 
your answer as a fraction pq in reduced form
