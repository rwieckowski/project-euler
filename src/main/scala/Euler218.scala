/**
Consider the right angled triangle with sides a7 b24 and c25The area 
of this triangle is 84 which is divisible by the perfect numbers 6 and 
28
Moreover it is a primitive right angled triangle as gcdab1 and gcdbc1
Also c is a perfect square

We will call a right angled triangle perfect if
it is a primitive right angled triangle
its hypotenuse is a perfect square

We will call a right angled triangle superperfect if
it is a perfect right angled triangle and
its area is a multiple of the perfect numbers 6 and 28

How many perfect rightangled triangles with cle10<sup>16</sup> exist 
that are not superperfect
