/**
Take the number 192 and multiply it by each of 1 2 and 3<blockquote>
192 times 1  192
192 times 2  384
192 times 3  576</blockquote>

By concatenating each product we get the 1 to 9 pandigital 192384576 
We will call 192384576 the concatenated product of 192 and 123

The same can be achieved by starting with 9 and multiplying by 1 2 3 4 
and 5 giving the pandigital 918273645 which is the concatenated 
product of 9 and 12345

What is the largest 1 to 9 pandigital 9digit number that can be formed 
as the concatenated product of an integer with 12   <var>n</var> where 
<var>n</var> gt 1
