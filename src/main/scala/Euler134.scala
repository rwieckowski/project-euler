/**
Consider the consecutive primes <i>p</i><sub>1</sub>  19 and <i>p</i>
<sub>2</sub>  23 It can be verified that 1219 is the smallest number 
such that the last digits are formed by <i>p</i><sub>1</sub> whilst 
also being divisible by <i>p</i><sub>2</sub>

In fact with the exception of <i>p</i><sub>1</sub>  3 and <i>p</i>
<sub>2</sub>  5 for every pair of consecutive primes <i>p</i><sub>2
</sub> gt <i>p</i><sub>1</sub> there exist values of <i>n</i> for 
which the last digits are formed by <i>p</i><sub>1</sub> and <i>n</i> 
is divisible by <i>p</i><sub>2</sub> Let <i>S</i> be the smallest of 
these values of <i>n</i>

Find sum <i>S</i> for every pair of consecutive primes with 5 le <i>p
</i><sub>1</sub> le 1000000
