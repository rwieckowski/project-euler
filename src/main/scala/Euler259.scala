/**
A positive integer will be called <i>reachable</i> if it can result 
from an arithmetic expression obeying the following rules<ul><li>Uses 
the digits 1 through 9 in that order and exactly once each</li><li>Any 
successive digits can be concatenated for example using the digits 2 3 
and 4 we obtain the number 234</li><li>Only the four usual binary 
arithmetic operations addition subtraction multiplication and division 
are allowed</li><li>Each operation can be used any number of times or 
not at all</li><li>
<dfn title='A minus sign applied to a single operand (as opposed to a subtraction operator between two operands)'>
Unary minus</dfn> is not allowed</li><li>Any number of possibly nested 
parentheses may be used to define the order of operations</li></ul>

For example 42 is reachable since 123  456  789  42

What is the sum of all positive reachable integers
