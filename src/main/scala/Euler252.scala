/**
Given a set of points on a plane we define a convex hole to be a 
convex polygon having as vertices any of the given points and not 
containing any of the given points in its interior in addition to the 
vertices other given points may lie on the perimeter of the polygon 

As an example the image below shows a set of twenty points and a few 
such convex holes The convex hole shown as a red heptagon has an area 
equal to 10496945 square units which is the highest possible area for 
a convex hole on the given set of points
