/**
In Platos heaven there exist an infinite number of bowls in a straight 
line
Each bowl either contains some or none of a finite number of beans
A child plays a game which allows only one kind of move removing two 
beans from any bowl and putting one in each of the two adjacent bowls
 The game ends when each bowl contains either one or no beans

For example consider two adjacent bowls containing 2 and 3 beans 
respectively all other bowls being empty The following eight moves 
will finish the game<div align='center'>
