We shall say that an <var>n</var>digit number is pandigital if it 
makes use of all the digits 1 to <var>n</var> exactly once for example 
the 5digit number 15234 is 1 through 5 pandigital

The product 7254 is unusual as the identity 39 times 186  7254 
containing multiplicand multiplier and product is 1 through 9 
pandigital

Find the sum of all products whose multiplicandmultiplierproduct 
identity can be written as a 1 through 9 pandigital<div class="note">
HINT Some products can be obtained in more than one way so be sure to 
only include it once in your sum
