<P>The number 7 is special because 7 is 111 written in base 2 and 11 
written in base 6 <BR/>ie 7<sub>10</sub>  11<sub>6</sub>  111<sub>2
</sub> In other words 7 is a repunit in at least two bases b  1 </P>
<P>We shall call a positive integer with this property a strong 
repunit It can be verified that there are 8 strong repunits below 50  
17131521314043 <BR/>Furthermore the sum of all strong repunits below 
1000 equals 15864</P>Find the sum of all strong repunits below 10<sup>
