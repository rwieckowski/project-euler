/**
<P>The first 15 fibonacci numbers are<BR />1123581321345589144233377
610<BR />It can be seen that 8 and 144 are not squarefree 8 is 
divisible by 4 and 144 is divisible by 4 and by 9<BR /> So the first 
13 squarefree fibonacci numbers are<BR />112351321345589233377 and 610
</P><P>The 200th squarefree fibonacci number is
971183874599339129547649988289594072811608739584170445<BR />The last 
sixteen digits of this number are 1608739584170445 and in scientific 
notation this number can be written as 97e53</P><P>Find the 100 000 
000th squarefree fibonacci number<BR />Give as your answer its last 
sixteen digits followed by a comma followed by the number in 
scientific notation rounded to one digit after the decimal point<BR />
For the 200th squarefree number the answer would have been 
160873958417044597e53</P><P><Font size=-1>Note<BR /> For this problem 
assume that for every prime p the first fibonacci number divisible by 
p is not divisible by p<sup>2</sup> this is part of <b>Walls 
conjecture</b> This has been verified for primes le 310<sup>15</sup> 
but has not been proven in general<BR />If it happens that the 
conjecture is false then the accepted answer to this problem isnt 
guaranteed to be the 100 000 000th squarefree fibonacci number rather 
it represents only a lower bound for that number</FONT></P>
