Tatami are rectangular mats used to completely cover the floor of a 
room without overlap

Assuming that the only type of available tatami has dimensions 1times2 
there are obviously some limitations for the shape and size of the 
rooms that can be covered

For this problem we consider only rectangular rooms with integer 
dimensions <var>a</var> <var>b</var> and even size <var>s</var>  <var>
a</var>middot<var>b</var>
We use the term size to denote the floor surface area of the room and 
mdash without loss of generality mdash we add the condition <var>a
</var> le <var>b</var>

There is one rule to follow when laying out tatami there must be no 
points where corners of four different mats meet
For example consider the two arrangements below for a 4times4 room
