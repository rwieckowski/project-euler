/**
A firecracker explodes at a height of 100 m above level ground It 
breaks into a large number of very small fragments which move in every 
direction all of them have the same initial velocity of 20 ms

We assume that the fragments move without air resistance in a uniform 
gravitational field with g981 ms<sup>2</sup>

Find the volume in m<sup>3</sup> of the region through which the 
fragments move before reaching the ground Give your answer rounded to 
four decimal places
