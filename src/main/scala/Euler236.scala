Suppliers A and B provided the following numbers of products for the 
luxury hamper market

<center><table class="p236"><tr><th>Product</th>
<th style="text-align:center">A</th><th style="text-align:center">B
</th></tr><tr><td>Beluga Caviar</td><td>5248</td><td>640</td></tr><tr>
<td>Christmas Cake</td><td>1312</td><td>1888</td></tr><tr><td>Gammon 
Joint</td><td>2624</td><td>3776</td></tr><tr><td>Vintage Port</td><td>

Although the suppliers try very hard to ship their goods in perfect 
condition there is inevitably some spoilage  <i>ie</i> products gone 
bad

The suppliers compare their performance using two types of statistic
<ul>  <li>The five <i>perproduct spoilage rates</i> for each supplier 
are equal to the number of products gone bad divided by the number of 
products supplied for each of the five products in turn</li>  <li>The 
<i>overall spoilage rate</i> for each supplier is equal to the total 
number of products gone bad divided by the total number of products 
provided by that supplier</li></ul>

To their surprise the suppliers found that each of the five perproduct 
spoilage rates was worse higher for B than for A by the same factor 
ratio of spoilage rates <var>m</var>1 and yet paradoxically the 
overall spoilage rate was worse for A than for B also by a factor of 
<var>m</var>

There are thirtyfive <var>m</var>gt1 for which this surprising result 
could have occurred the smallest of which is 14761475

Whats the largest possible value of <var>m</var>
Give your answer as a fraction reduced to its lowest terms in the form 
<var>u</var><var>v</var>
