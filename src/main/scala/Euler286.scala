Barbara is a mathematician and a basketball player She has found that 
the probability of scoring a point when shooting from a distance <var>
x</var> is exactly 1thinsp <sup><var>x</var></sup><sub><var>q</var>
</sub> where <var>q</var> is a real constant greater than 50

During each practice run she takes shots from distances <var>x</var>
thinspthinsp1 <var>x</var>thinspthinsp2  <var>x</var>thinspthinsp50 
and according to her records she has precisely a 2thinsp chance to 
score a total of exactly 20 points

Find <var>q</var> and give your answer rounded to 10 decimal places
