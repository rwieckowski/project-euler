/**
Julie proposes the following wager to her sister Louise
She suggests they play a game of chance to determine who will wash the 
dishes
For this game they shall use a generator of independent random numbers 
uniformly distributed between 0 and 1
The game starts with <var>S</var>  0
The first player Louise adds to <var>S</var> different random numbers 
from the generator until <var>S</var>  1 and records her last random 
number <var>x</var>
The second player Julie continues adding to <var>S</var> different 
random numbers from the generator until <var>S</var>  2 and records 
her last random number <var>y</var>
The player with the highest number wins and the loser washes the 
dishes ie if <var>y</var>  <var>x</var> the second player wins

For e<var>x</var>ample if the first player draws 062 and 044 the first 
player turn ends since 062044  1 and <var>x</var>  044
If the second players draws 01 027 and 091 the second player turn ends 
since 06204401027091  2 and <var>y</var>  091Since <var>y</var>  <var>
x</var> the second player wins

Louise thinks about it for a second and objects Thats not fair
What is the probability that the second player wins
Give your answer rounded to 10 places behind the decimal point in the 
form 0abcdefghij
