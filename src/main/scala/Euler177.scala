/**
Let ABCD be a convex quadrilateral with diagonals AC and BD At each 
vertex the diagonal makes an angle with each of the two sides creating 
eight corner angles

<img src="project/images/p177_quad.gif" alt="" />

For example at vertex A the two angles are CAD CAB

We call such a quadrilateral for which all eight corner angles have 
integer values when measured in degrees an quotinteger angled 
quadrilateralquot An example of an integer angled quadrilateral is a 
square where all eight corner angles are 45deg Another example is 
given by DAC  20deg BAC  60deg ABD  50deg CBD  30deg BCA  40deg DCA  
30deg CDB  80deg ADB  50deg

What is the total number of nonsimilar integer angled quadrilaterals

Note In your calculations you may assume that a calculated angle is 
integral if it is within a tolerance of 10<sup>9</sup> of an integer 
value
