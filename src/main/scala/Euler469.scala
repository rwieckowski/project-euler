/**
In a room <var>N</var> chairs are placed around a round table
Knights enter the room one by one and choose at random an available 
empty chair
To have enough elbow room the knights always leave at least one empty 
chair between each other

When there arent any suitable chairs left the fraction <var>C</var> of 
empty chairs is determined
We also define E<var>N</var> as the expected value of <var>C</var>
We can verify that E4  12 and E6  59

Find E10<sup>18</sup> Give your answer rounded to fourteen decimal 
places in the form 0abcdefghijklmn
