/**
If a box contains twentyone coloured discs composed of fifteen blue 
discs and six red discs and two discs were taken at random it can be 
seen that the probability of taking two blue discs PBB  1521times1420  
12

The next such arrangement for which there is exactly 50 chance of 
taking two blue discs at random is a box containing eightyfive blue 
discs and thirtyfive red discs

By finding the first arrangement to contain over 10<sup>12</sup>  1000
000000000 discs in total determine the number of blue discs that the 
box would contain
