/**
An electric circuit uses exclusively identical capacitors of the same 
value C
The capacitors can be connected in series or in parallel to form sub
units which can then be connected in series or in parallel with other 
capacitors or other subunits to form larger subunits and so on up to a 
final circuit

Using this simple procedure and up to <var>n</var> identical 
capacitors we can make circuits having a range of different total 
capacitances For example using up to <var>n</var>3 capacitors of 60
