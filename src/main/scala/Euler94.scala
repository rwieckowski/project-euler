/**
It is easily proved that no equilateral triangle exists with integral 
length sides and integral area However the <i>almost equilateral 
triangle</i> 556 has an area of 12 square units

We shall define an <i>almost equilateral triangle</i> to be a triangle 
for which two sides are equal and the third differs by no more than 
one unit

Find the sum of the perimeters of all <i>almost equilateral triangles
</i> with integral side lengths and area and whose perimeters do not 
exceed one billion 1000000000
