/**
A row of <var>n</var> squares contains a frog in the leftmost square 
By successive jumps the frog goes to the rightmost square and then 
back to the leftmost square On the outward trip he jumps one two or 
three squares to the right and on the homeward trip he jumps to the 
left in a similar manner He cannot jump outside the squares He repeats 
the roundtrip travel <var>m</var> times

Let F<var>m</var> <var>n</var> be the number of the ways the frog can 
travel so that at most one square remains unvisited
For example F1 3  4 F1 4  15 F1 5  46 F2 3  16 and F2 100 mod 10<sup>9
</sup>  429619151

Find the last 9 digits of F10 10<sup>12</sup>
