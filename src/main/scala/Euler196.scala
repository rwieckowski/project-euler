Each positive integer has up to eight neighbours in the triangle

A set of three primes is called a <i>prime triplet</i> if one of the 
three primes has the other two as neighbours in the triangle

For example in the second row the prime numbers 2 and 3 are elements 
of some prime triplet

If row 8 is considered it contains two primes which are elements of 
some prime triplet ie 29 and 31
If row 9 is considered it contains only one prime which is an element 
of some prime triplet 37

Define S<var>n</var> as the sum of the primes in row <var>n</var> 
which are elements of any prime triplet
Then S860 and S937

You are given that S10000950007619

Find  S5678027  S7208785
